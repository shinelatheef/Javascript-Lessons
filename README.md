# LEARNING JAVASCRIPT 

Founder of Javascript is Brendan Eich in 1995.

Mocha > Livescript > JavaScript.

The first browser was called World Wide Web, founded by Tim Berners Lee in 1990.

The most commonly used web browser in the 90s was Netscape Navigator (1994-2008).

Internet Explorer was created in 1995 and expired in 2022.

Netscape and Internet Explorer were the two most popular browsers by the year 2000.

The problem was that both these web browsers were using two different programming languages (J-Script for internet explorer and Livescript for netscape).

Therefore, the developers had a tough time writing code for these two browsers with two different programming languages.

ECMAScript (European Computers Manufacturer Association Script) came into the picture in 1997 and decided to standardise the programming languages.

Syntax is a set of rules to be followed when you write code. It is to coding what grammar is to literature.

The most common difference between java and javascript is that java is a compiled programming language whereas javascript is an interpreted programming language. 

In compiled programming languages => Code is executed collectively and is very quick.

In interpreted programming languages => Code is executed line by line and is slower.

Some examples of compiled programming languages are Java, C/C++, Swift.

Some examples of Interpreted programming languages are Javascript, Python, Ruby.

Why Javascript? Javascript is the most popular programming language. Traditionally, it was a front end language meant to add some animation to your website or allow a little bit of user interaction. Nowadays, Javascript can be seen ranging from front end to back end and everything in between. It is the one language that is supported by all the major browsers. It is still the language that runs the web and this is evident from the popularity of javascript.

HTML creates content for the website (buttons, text, images); CSS changes the appearance of the website; JavaScript makes the website interactive.

The fundamentals of JavaScript:
- Values/Datatypes
- Variables
- Operators
- Conditions
- Loops 
- Functions
