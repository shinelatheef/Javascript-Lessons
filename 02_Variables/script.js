// Naming conventions
// 1. Variables are case sensitive.
// 2. Variables can be single-character, multi-character or alphanumeric.
// 3. Camel-casing is the best practice.
// 4. Only two symbols can be used; underscore(_) and dollar($).
// 5. Variables cannot start with numbers.
// 6. Variables cannot have spaces in them.
// 7. Variables cannot have keywords in them.
